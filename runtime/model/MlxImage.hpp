// Plans the images of a safetensors target, MLX's, Model Optimizer's or
// compressed-tensors': the sections a GGUF target's images hold
// (model/GgufImage.hpp), in their order, which writeGgufImage writes from the
// checkpoint's tensors and BlockTargetFormat reads with the GDN value heads
// grouped, as all keep them. Every quantized tensor keeps the format its
// tensors hold: MLX affine (metal/abi/QuantFormat.h), mxfp4 or nvfp4 as MLX
// infers it, or NVFP4 or FP8 as the other two store them: projections and
// experts as planes, a quantized token table as native rows. An unquantized
// token table is copied as its bf16 rows. Norms are bf16 as MLX stores them, or the F32 1 + w of the w
// transformers stores; the convolution and dt_bias are copied as stored, and
// the GDN decay is float(-exp(double(A_log))). The MoE router and the
// shared-expert gate, which the block kernels read in F32, become the F32
// values of their quantization (or of their bf16 weights), and so do GDN
// alpha and beta unless both are quantized in one format.
